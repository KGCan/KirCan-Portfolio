## Concept

Create a portfolio that showcases work samples using react. Single page application portfolio for a web developer deployed using GitHub Pages.  The portfolio includes a header and footer section with tabs to view work samples as well as a contact form, and a link to my resume.

## Goals

- a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
- I load the portfolio
- I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
- I view the header
- I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
- I view the navigation titles
- I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- I click on a navigation title
- I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
- I load the portfolio the first time
- the About Me title and section are selected by default
- I am presented with the About Me section
- I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them

- I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
- I am presented with the Contact section
- I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
- I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
- I receive a notification that this field is required
- I enter text into the email address field
- I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
- I am presented with the Resume section
